# Impossible Chessboard Escape Puzzle

Solution implementation by Cory Leigh Rahman

## Puzzle Prompt

Prisoner 1 walks in to a room, sees a chessboard where each square has a coin on top, flipped either to heads or tails.  The warden places the key under one of the squares, which prisoner 1 sees.  Before he leaves, he must turn over one and only one coin.  Prisoner 2 then walks in and is supposed to be able to figure out which squares the key is in just by looking at the arrangement of coins. The Prisoners can coordinate a plan ahead of time. What's the plan?
